**PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration**

**Introduction**

PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration is a comprehensive project aimed at analyzing and visualizing data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.
This project provides a user-friendly tool for exploring various metrics and statistics related to PhonePe transactions, users, and insurance.
Leveraging Python, Pandas, MySQL, Streamlit, and Plotly, the dashboard extracts, transforms, and presents data in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.

**Problem Statement**

The PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository contains extensive data on various metrics and statistics.
The challenge lies in extracting, processing, and visualizing this data to derive meaningful insights.
The goal is to transform raw data into digestible visualizations that facilitate decision-making and deeper understanding of PhonePe's performance and trends.

**Project Approach**

The project follows a structured approach to address the problem statement effectively:

**1. Data Extraction**

Objective: Extract data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.

Steps:

Import necessary libraries: streamlit, mysql.connector, pandas, plotly, requests, json.

Establish MySQL database connection.

Retrieve data from MySQL tables: aggregated_insurance, aggregated_transaction, aggregated_user, map_insurance, map_transaction, map_user, top_insurance, top_transaction, top_user.

Close the database connection.

**2. Data Transformation**

Objective: Transform and preprocess the extracted data for analysis and visualization.

Steps:

Define functions for data analysis and visualization.

Implement data transformation operations within each function.

Utilize Pandas and Plotly libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

**3. Database Insertion**

Objective: Store the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.

Steps:

Connect to the MySQL database.

Insert the transformed data into appropriate tables.

Commit the changes and close the database connection.

**4. Dashboard Creation**

Objective: Develop an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.

Steps:

Use Streamlit to create the dashboard layout.

Integrate Plotly for generating interactive visualizations.

Implement dropdown menus and sliders for user interaction.

Display various insights and metrics based on user selections.

**5. Data Retrieval**

Objective: Fetch data from the MySQL database to update the dashboard dynamically.

Steps:

Connect to the MySQL database.

Retrieve the required data into Pandas data frames.

Utilize the fetched data to update the dashboard visualizations.

**6. Deployment**

Objective: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly, and deploy the dashboard publicly.

Steps:

Thoroughly test the solution for accuracy and functionality.

Deploy the dashboard using suitable hosting services.

Make the dashboard accessible to users for exploration and analysis.

**Conclusion**

The PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration project adopts a systematic approach to analyze and visualize data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.
By effectively extracting, transforming, and presenting data using Python, Pandas, MySQL, Streamlit, and Plotly, the project provides actionable insights into PhonePe's performance and trends.
The interactive dashboard empowers users to explore various metrics and statistics, facilitating informed decision-making and deeper understanding of PhonePe's ecosystem.
